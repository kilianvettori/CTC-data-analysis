# CTC-data-analysis
CTC - Coulometric titration comparison:  The following code can be used to compare the coulometric titration curves of one active  material (AM) in two different systems (can be cells, electrolytes, ...). Here, CTC is applied to NCM in typical liquid and solid electrolyte to obtain the mass of active material.
