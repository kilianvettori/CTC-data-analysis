CTC - Coulometric titration comparison:  The following code can be used to compare the coulometric titration curves of one active  material (AM) in two different systems (can be cells, electrolytes, ...).
Here, CTC is applied to NCM in typical liquid and solid electrolyte to obtain the mass of active material.

This repository contains the Python code for this task, as described in the accompanying ChemComm manuscript.
It is recommended for other researchers to evaluate their own CTC measurement data using the same workflow

## Contents
- `notebooks/`  
  Jupyter notebook(s) for evaluating CTC measurement files.

- `data/`  
  Coulometric titration data (good SSB, bad SSB, LIB) and Measurement files (good SSB, bad SSB) as used in the manuscript.

- `output/`  
  Evaluated data files generated by the analysis (not tracked by default).


## Requirements (`requirements.txt`)

- Python 3.9 or later
- Standard scientific Python packages:
    os #to open files
    numpy as np #to get access to np.random.uniform(), np.array(), np.float, np.average, np.sqrt
    pandas as pd #to process data in dataframes
    matplotlib.pyplot as plt #for plotting
    scipy.interpolate (interp1d) #for interpolation of the titration data

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place your coulometric titration data files in the `data/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
4. Adjust file paths and input parameters as needed.
5. Run the notebook to generate evaluated output files.

The generated output files can be further processed or plotted as desired.
